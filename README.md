Server script is in `server/main.js`

To run the code you need to install dependencies in both `./` and `./server/`.

Please feel free to use Yarn or NPM.

After all dependencies have been installed:

1. Run `npm run start:front` to start frontend.
2. `npm run start:back` to run backend.

If there are any issues, please feel free to reach out directly to me.
